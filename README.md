# Abstraction-and-Encapsulation
In contrast to _**encapsulation**_, which groups data and operations and restricts access to an object's internal state, _**abstraction**_ concentrates on building high-level models by obscuring superfluous details. Together, they encourage the modular design of object-oriented systems, code reuse, and simpler maintenance.
